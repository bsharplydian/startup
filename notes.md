# CS 260 notes

## Setup
GitHub conflicts:
 - easily merged using VS Code, which allows you to choose a commit to keep

 ## HTML
I'm familiar with basic HTML, so this section was mostly review. There were a few things I thought were interesting:
- \<img> tags don't have a closing tag since they don't contain any text
- scaling the width of an image automatically scales the height
- links require the https:// prefix to work correctly
- I wonder if there's a way to store the header or footer information separately so that it can be easily duplicated and modified across pages
